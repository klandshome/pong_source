# pong_source
Pong in C++
download compressed file from link above

To run the game just run “pong_file.exe” located inside the “pong_final” folder.  All the necessary libraries and assets are included in the folder.  To view the actual code, just look inside the “pong_source” folder.  Hit the space bar while running the game to change the angle of the ball and the speed it travels.  Move the paddle left and right with the arrows keys on the keyboard and try not to prevent the ball from passing the paddle.  If the ball passes, a message warning you will be displayed across the center of the window.  Close the program by “x-ing” out the window.

This project was a good entry point in the field of game development.  Just drawing a pixel to the screen (let alone moving it) is a science and really brings into perspective the talent and hard work that many game developers entail to design and build games from the ground up. 
Some concepts I learned/used:
-	graphics libraries
-	frame rates
-	motion
-	collision detection
-	sprites and drawing
-	key presses
-	fonts
-	game loops
-	events
-	assets/art
Game development is extremely detail-oriented and time-consuming.  However, it is possibly the most rewarding form of programming.  For that, I respect it dearly.  There is much to learn and this is not even scratching the surface.  I have to brush up on my physics (for better collision detection and animations) and my maths (trigonometry, calculus, linear algebra).  Then there is artificial intelligence, and using 3D with DirectX, sounds, multithreading, and a whole slew of topics to learn and keep building on.  It is a commitment and I hope to tackle it in the future.
